# Flight-Performance-Analysis
I love airplanes! But, before choosing a flight, I always question the likelihood of this flight not canceling? What are the chances of me facing a massive delay? If I have a connecting flight, how much of a delay can I bear on my first flight to not miss my second flight? I am always asking these questions before booking a flight, and I also believe these are some of the questions that any passenger would think about before choosing a flight. Fortunately, I was able to find a dataset that consists of flight arrivals and departures details of all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and it takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. To ensure that I can properly work on the dataset, I decided only to use the data of 2007 flights. However, the methodologies used for the findings can be extended to any year's data.
